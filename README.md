⚠️NOTE: This project/repository/(whatever the name is, I don't care) not include 'cpp' or the library because when I build this I found an error that I can't fix because I really not understand how to code c & c++, so I just build the java code then I put the library from the original app (up there) file 'lib/armeabi-v7a/libbrewemu.so' to inside the apk then I sign the apk
