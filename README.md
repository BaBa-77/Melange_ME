⚠️NOTE: This projects/repository/(whatever mame is, I don't care) not include 'cpp' or the library because I found an error that I couldn't fix because I really not understand how to code c & c++, so I just build the java code then put the library from the original app (up there) file 'lib/armeabi-v7a/libbrewemu.so' to inside the apk then I sign the apk
